# CC_Cluster_NNReg
This is a case in Machine Learning models. In this case, we are working for a bank to define the credit limit of potential new clients. We will consider the dataset as potential clients, and from their data we will create a model for future new clients.

These are our objectives in this case:

1) Perform a quick EDA of the dataset
2) Clean and pre-process the data
3) Use clustering models to find the optimal nยบ of clusters
4) Add a label to each row based on what cluster it belongs
5) Execute a Neural Network Regression model to properly predict the credit limit of clients.
